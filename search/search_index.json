Mongodump : Export source data and import into Staging mongo instance (dSource). Useful for offline/online backups of small databases (onprem, Saas, MongoAtlas) Replication : Add replicaset member to existing cluster. Mongo Ops Manager : Use existing backups downloaded as compressed file(s) from Mongo OPS Manager. Ingestion Types: \u00b6 dSource Type Mechanism Zero Touch Prod Description Seed New Mongo Instance - New empty mongo instance created by delphix. This is for development purpose without any source extendedcluster Add member to existing replicaset N Add member to existing source replicaset. Instant and near realtime snapshots onlinemongodump mongodump N Delphix connects to source from staging environments, executes mongodump and capture source data. offlinemongodump mongodump Y Delphix leverages existing mongodumps made available to staging host.

User responsible to create working mongo instance on staging host Seed \u00b6 This type of dSource is generally used for pure development purpose. There is no source instance associated with it. It creates a empty instance which is managed by delphix and helps to create virtual mongo instance to avail benefits of all delphix features. Mongodump (offlinemongodump) \u00b6 This type of dsource is created using mongodump backup file of source mongo instance. It helps to create dsource using zero touch production. Periodic backups can be loaded to create timeline of dsource. Mongodump (onlinemongodump) \u00b6 This type of dsource is created using mongodump backup file of source mongo instance. It helps to create dsource using online backup. It can run in regular mode or logsync mode. logsync mode helps to capture oplogs for incremental snapsyncs and reduce backup time and size. Periodic backups can be loaded to create timeline of dsource. Extended Cluster (extendedcluster) \u00b6 This type of dsource is created by adding secondary member to existing source cluster. This member does not participate in voting and never becomes primary nor serves any read operations. Its the fastest way of capturing incremental and multiple snapshots can be taken to get desired timeline. Mongo OPS Manager backups (sharded mongo) \u00b6 This type of dsource is created using backup file of source mongo instance created by mongo ops manager. It helps to create dsource of sharded source cluster. It helps to create dsource using zero touch production. Periodic backups can be loaded to create timeline of dsource. Mongo OPS Manager backups (non-sharded mongo replicaet) \u00b6 This type of dsource is created using backup file of source mongo instance created by mongo ops manager. It helps to create dsource of non-sharded source cluster. It helps to create dsource using zero touch production. Periodic backups can be loaded to create timeline of dsource. Staging Push ( Mongo OPS Manager with Automation ) (stagingpush) \u00b6 This type of dsource is similar to extended cluster. When Mongo Ops Manager is configured with automation, it does not allow any cluster modification commands outside Mongo Ops Manager. When creating dsource of staging push type, delphix creates an empty filesystem on staging host. You can create mongo instance using Mongo Ops Manager on delphix filesystem and take new delphix snapshot. Delete any previous snapshot generateed before creating mongo instance. Delphix will take periodic snapshots based on snapsync policy which can be used to create VDBs.

A dSource is a virtualized representation of a physical or logical source database. You must create a virtual database (VDB) from a dSource snapshot. A VDB is an independent, writable copy of a dSource snapshot. You can also create VDBs from other VDBs. Once you have provisioned a VDB to a target environment, you can also implement snapshot and retention policies for the VDB, which will determine how frequently Delphix Engine will take a database snapshot and how long the snapshots will be retained for recovery and provisioning purposes. Snapshots accumulate over time. To view a snapshot: From the Datasets panel, click the group containing the dSource. Select dSource. Click the TimeFlow tab. The TimeFlow appears as a list of dates, each of which expands to show snapshots from that date. Times, when the VDB has been refreshed, are marked by a blue line between dates. On the TimeFlow, you can also filter by type of snapshot. To do so, click the filter button, which is shaped like an eye. You can scroll through these lists to select the one you want, or you can enter a date and time to search for a specific snapshot. Once you have provisioned a VDB, you can also take snapshots of it. As with the dSource snapshots, you can find these when you select the VDB in the Datasets panel. You can then provision additional VDBs from these VDB snapshots. Dependencies If there are dependencies on the snapshot, you will not be able to delete the snapshot free space; the dependencies rely on the data associated with the snapshot. Provisioning VDB \u00b6 This topic describes how to provision a virtual database (VDB) from a mongo dSource. Prerequisites \u00b6 Install delphix engine 5.3.x and above Install mongo binaries on staging host Execute Discovery on staging host Create dSource on staging host Add target environment to delphix Create VDB \u00b6 Procedure: Login to the Delphix Management application. Click Manage. Select Datasets. Select a dSource. Select a snapshot from which you want to provision. Click Provision VDB icon to open Provision VDB wizard. Select a target environment from the left pane. Select an Installation to use from the dropdown list of available mongo binaries on that environment. Select the Environment User. Enter VDB parameters. Select a Target Group for the VDB. Click the green Plus icon to add a new group, if necessary. Select a Snapshot Policy for the VDB. Click Next. Specify any desired hook operations. Click Next. Review the Provisioning Configuration and Data Management information. Click Submit. When provisioning starts, you can review the progress of the job in the Databases panel, or in the Job History panel of the Dashboard. When provisioning is complete, the VDB will be included in the group you designated and listed in the Databases panel. If you select the VDB in the Databases panel and click the Open icon, you can view its card, which contains information about the database and its Data Management settings.","title":"Provisioning"},{"location":"Provisioning.html#provisioning","text":"This topic describes the basic concepts involved with provisioning VDBs for Mongo.
